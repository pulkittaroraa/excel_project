Bike Purchase Analysis and Visualization

Project Overview:

The focus was on analyzing a dataset of bike buyers to extract meaningful insights and present them through an interactive dashboard.

Dataset Description

Source: Excel file containing data on bike buyers
Columns: ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike

Project Steps

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
Cleaned the dataset to handle any inconsistencies or missing values.
Created age brackets to facilitate easier visualization based on age groups.

Pivot Table Creation:

Pivot Table 1: Displayed average income based on gender and bike purchase status.
Pivot Table 2: Showed the count of purchased bikes based on commute distance.
Pivot Table 3: Illustrated the count of purchased bikes categorized by age brackets.

Chart Development:

Developed charts for each pivot table to provide a visual representation of the data.

Dashboard Creation:

Assembled the charts into a consolidated dashboard titled "Bike Sales Dashboard."
Incorporated three slicers based on marital status, education, and region to enable dynamic data filtering and visualization.

Dashboard Features

Interactive Charts: Visualize key metrics such as average income, bike purchases by commute distance, and age brackets.
Slicers: Filter data interactively by marital status, education, and region to gain targeted insights.

Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to handle and analyze large datasets, create meaningful visualizations, and build interactive dashboards using Excel. It highlights my skills in data cleaning, pivot table creation, and data visualization.
